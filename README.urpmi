Since Mageia 3 there are two ways of using Wireshark/Tshark:

1. Using dumpcap without allowing non-root users to capture packets

   Only root user will be able to capture packets. It is advised to capture
   packets with the bundled dumpcap program as root and then run 
   Wireshark/Tshark as an ordinary user to analyze the captured logs. [2]

   This is the default.

2. Using dumpcap and allowing non-root users to capture packets

   Members of the wireshark group will be able to capture packets on network 
   interfaces. This is the preferred way of installation if Wireshark/Tshark
   will be used for capturing and displaying packets at the same time, since
   that way only the dumpcap process has to be run with elevated privileges 
   thanks to the privilege separation [1].

   Note that no user will be added to group wireshark automatically, the 
   system administrator has to add them manually.
